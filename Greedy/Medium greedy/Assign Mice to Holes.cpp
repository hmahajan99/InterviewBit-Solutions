// There are N Mice and N holes are placed in a straight line. Each hole can accomodate only 1 mouse.
// A mouse can stay at his position, move one step right from x to x + 1, or move one step left from x to x âˆ’ 1. 
// Any of these moves consumes 1 minute. Assign mice to holes so that the time when the last mouse gets inside a hole is minimized.

// Example:
// positions of mice are:
// 4 -4 2
// positions of holes are:
// 4 0 5

// Assign mouse at position x=4 to hole at position x=4 : Time taken is 0 minutes 
// Assign mouse at position x=-4 to hole at position x=0 : Time taken is 4 minutes 
// Assign mouse at position x=2 to hole at position x=5 : Time taken is 3 minutes 
// After 4 minutes all of the mice are in the holes.

// Since, there is no combination possible where the last mouse's time is less than 4, 
// answer = 4.

// Approach

// sort mice positions (in any order)
// sort hole positions 

// Loop i = 1 to N:
//     update ans according to the value of |mice(i) - hole(i)|

// Proof of correctness:
// Let i1 < i2 be the positions of two mice and let j1 < j2 be the positions of two holes.
// It suffices to show via case analysis that
// max(|i1 - j1|, |i2 - j2|) <= max(|i1 - j2|, |i2 - j1|) ,
