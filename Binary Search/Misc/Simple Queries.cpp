// You have to perform the following steps in a given order.
// generate all subarrays of A.
// take the maximum element from each subarray of A and insert it into a new array G.
// replace every element of G with the product of their divisors mod 1e9 + 7.
// sort G in descending order
// perform Q queries
// In each query, you are given an integer K, where you have to find the Kth element in G.
